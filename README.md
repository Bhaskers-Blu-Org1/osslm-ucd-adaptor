# Resource Manager adaptor for Urban Code Deploy (UCD)
For a more detailed overview and context of this project see [main Readme page]( https://github.com/IBM/open-source-service-lifecycle-mgmt/

This project provides a resource manager (RM) for ALM 1.1 based on UCD, see [Urban Code Deploy](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/products/urbancode-deploy/).


It implements the v1.0 Resource Manager API Specification.

The first starting point is to look at the Readme in [ucd-getting-started](./ucd-getting-started/README.md) which will quickly enable UCD to work with the ucd-driver.

Once you have completed the getting started section then look at the [ucd-adaptor reference implementation](./ucd-adaptor/README.md)
